#I don't even know what this was supposed to be. I think it was a leetcode question about doing some formula on any number > 100 and it would always end up at 99 or something.
#anyways here it is:


def subtract_sum(n):
    global emptyArr
    emptyArr = []
    answer = n
    while answer > 100:
        a = 0
        sum = [int(x) for x in str(answer)]
        for i in sum: a += i
        answer -= a
        emptyArr.append(answer)
    return answer

def subtract_sum2(n):
    global emptyArr2
    emptyArr2 = []
    answer = n
    while answer > 100:
        a = 0
        sum = [int(x) for x in str(answer)]
        for i in sum: a += i
        answer -= a
        emptyArr2.append(answer)
    return emptyArr2
